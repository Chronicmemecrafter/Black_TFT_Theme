# Black_TFT_Theme
A cool and simple black icon theme for BigTreeTech TFT displays. Full credit goes to u/Easy_Toast on reddit and check out his website at www.Sknight.cc. Maybe tip him a beer while you're there? This is just an updated version of his original design from his reddit post so that it is compatible with the latest version as of this repository's creation. I will try to continue to update this for as long as I'm using the theme.
